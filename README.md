# Chess
Unity 3D chess game. When everything will be working properly, I will start adding ML to it.

Current version: **v0.1-beta**

## Known bugs:
- En passant breaks pins;
- Double check breaks king move generation;
- Piece outline shader doesn't look the way it's intended in the builds;
- Sometime toggled pieces remain floating in the air.
